# Autoparts-Ecommerce-Website

(Individual Course Project)

CS6314.001-Team10-AutoParts-Store.pdf- Explains the complete functioning of the website 

Introduction and Instructions to run: 

Technologies Used: PHP, Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript and MYSQL database

In this project I have used the Bootstrap framework for overall view. And MYSQL for the database part. I have created homepages and views for the general user, as well as pages for the Admin user to add, edit, delete brands, categories and projects. This project is integrated with STRIPE and hence allows online payments.


1. This project requires us to give XAMPP certain privileges to execute properly. So please change the file permissions by executing the following command on the terminal for MAC/Linux systems:
          
          CHMOD R- 777 -directoryName
          
For example in this project we will be uploading hashed images url in the folder automatically - for which we need to give XAMPP the permission to write to the folder. This can be done by changing the file permissions, like above.


2. For STRIPE Integration to make payments possible, we need to first create an account with STRIPE. Stripe would then provide us with 2 API keys. One is a public key and the other is a private key. This helps with token authorization. Also we need install the PHP composer for executing the STRIPE composer- to enable STRIPE integration.


3. Place the folder in the XAMPP/ htdocs folder before running.


4. The SQL file for the database is provided.


5. The Admin email is: sara@gmail.com password: SuperAdmin1â€©
